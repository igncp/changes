The aim of this change is to translate the texts in English presented to the user to Spanish. The benefit is to search for all the texts in the GUI (and understand better the codebase structure). The objective is NOT to implement a i18n system to support both English and Spanish (that would be another and more complex change).

Notes:
- The Spanish version will not have accents
