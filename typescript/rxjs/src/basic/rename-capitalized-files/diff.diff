-### BREAKING CHANGES
-
-* Subject: Subject.create arguments have been swapped to match Rx 4 signature. `Subject.create(observable, observer)` is now `Subject.create(observer, observable)`
-* Observable patching: Patch files for static observable methods such as `of` and `from` can now be found in `rxjs/add/observable/of`, `rxjs/add/observable/from`, etc.
-* Observable modules: Observable modules for subclassed Observables like `PromiseObservable`, `ArrayObservable` are now in appropriately named files like `rxjs/observable/PromiseObservable` and `rxjs/observable/ArrayObservable`
-  as opposed to `rxjs/observable/fromPromise` and `rxjs/observable/fromArray`, since they're not patching, they simply house the Observable implementations.

-### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
-Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:
-
-* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/pulls) for an open or closed PR
-  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
-* Make your changes in a new git branch:
-
-     ```shell
-     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
-     ```
-
-* Create your patch, following [code style guidelines](#code), and **including appropriate test cases**.
-* Run the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.
-* Run the micro and macro performance tests against your feature branch and compare against master
-  to ensure performance wasn't changed for the worse.
-* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
-  [commit message conventions](#commit). Adherence to these conventions
-  is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
-
-     ```shell
-     git commit -a
-     ```
-  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.
-
-* Push your branch to GitHub:
-
-    ```shell
-    git push origin my-fix-branch
-    ```
-
-* In GitHub, send a pull request to `RxJS:master`.
-* If we suggest changes then:
-  * Make the required updates.
-  * Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
-  * Re-run performance tests to make sure your changes didn't hurt performance.
-  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):
-
-    ```shell
-    git rebase master -i
-    git push -f
-    ```
-
-That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
-
-
-#### After your pull request is merged
-
-After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
-from the main (upstream) repository:
-
-* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:
-
-    ```shell
-    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
-    ```
-
-* Check out the master branch:
-
-    ```shell
-    git checkout master -f
-    ```
-
-* Delete the local branch:
-
-    ```shell
-    git branch -D my-fix-branch
-    ```
-
-* Update your master with the latest upstream version:
-
-    ```shell
-    git pull --ff upstream master
-    ```
-
-### Coding Style Guidelines
-
-- Please use proper types and generics throughout your code.
-- 2 space indentation only
-- favor readability over terseness
-
-(TBD): For now try to follow the style that exists elsewhere in the source, and use your best judgment.
-
-
-### Unit Tests
-
-Unit tests are located under the [spec directory](/spec). Unit tests over synchronous operators and operations
-can be written in a standard [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) style. Unit tests written against any
-asynchronous operator should be written in [Marble Test Style outlined in detail here](doc/writing-marble-tests.md).
-
-Each operator under test must be in its own file to cover the following cases:
-
-- Never
-- Empty
-- Single/Multiple Values
-- Error in the sequence
-- Never ending sequences
-- Early disposal in sequences
-
-If the operator accepts a function as an argument from the user/developer (for example `filter(fn)` or `zip(a, fn)`),
-then it must cover the following cases:
-
-- Success with all values in the callback
-- Success with the context, if any allowed in the operator signature
-- If an error is thrown
-
-#### CI Tests
-- Using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) on your forked version of RxJS will allow running CI tests on that fork before submitting a PR to master
- - Simply create a `Travis` account and add your fork as a new project
-- [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) setup will allow performing automated browser tests on the fork. Since `saucelabs` doesn't perform browser tests on a PR, this will help verify test results before PR's are checked into master.
- - In your `Travis` repo configuration, set the environment variables SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY to your `saucelabs` account ([reference](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1210596/12679038/b9ba4eb6-c656-11e5-8c9b-b063c9a3f9dc.png))
-- As master runs both of these tests per each check in, it'd be welcome to setup those test before creating your PR
-
-### Performance Tests
-
-One of the primary goals of this library is (and will continue to be) great performance. As such, we've employed a variety of performance
-testing techniques.
-
-  - DON'T labor over minute variations in ops/sec or milliseconds, there will always be variance in perf test results.
-  - DON'T alter a performance test unless absolutely necessary. Performance tests may be compared to previous results from previous builds.
-  - DO run tests multiple times and make sure the margins of error are low
-  - DO run tests in your feature branches and compare them to master
-  - DO add performance tests for all new operators
-  - DO add performance tests that you feel are missing from other operators
-  - DO add additional performance tests for all worthy code paths. If you develop an operator with special handling for scalar observables,
-    please add tests for those scenarios
-
-
-#### Macro
-
-[Macro performance tests](perf/macro) are best written for scenarios where many object instance allocations (or deallocations) are occurring. Operators
-that create a lot of child subscriptions, or operators that emit new objects like Observables and Subjects are definitely worth creating
-macro performance tests for.
-
-Other scenarios for macro performance testing may include common end-to-end scenarios from real-world apps. If you have a situation in your
-app where you feel RxJS is performing poorly, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/) and include a minimal code example showing
-your performance issues. We would love to solve perf for your real-world problems and add those tests to our perf test battery.
-
-Macro performance tests can be run by hosting the root directory with any web server (we use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)),
-then running:
-
-```sh
-npm run build_all
-protractor protractor.conf.js
-```
-
-
-#### Micro
-
-[Micro performance tests](perf/micro) really only serve to test operations per second. They're quick and easy to develop, and provide a reasonable look into the
-relative performance of our operators versus prior versions. All operators should have corresponding micro performance tests.
-
-Micro performance test can be run with:
-
-```sh
-npm run build_all
-node perf/micro
-```
-
-If you wish to run a single micro performance test, you can do so by providing a single argument with the name of the perf test file(s):
-
-```sh
-node perf/micro zip
-```
-
-## Commit Message Guidelines
-
-We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
-readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
-we use the git commit messages to **generate the RxJS change log**. Helper script `npm run commit`
-provides command line based wizard to format commit message easily.
-
-### Commit Message Format
-Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
-format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:
-
-```
-<type>(<scope>): <subject>
-<BLANK LINE>
-<body>
-<BLANK LINE>
-<footer>
-```
-
-The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.
-
-Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
-to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
-
-### Revert
-If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
-
-### Type
-Must be one of the following:
-
-* **feat**: A new feature
-* **fix**: A bug fix
-* **docs**: Documentation only changes
-* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
-  semi-colons, etc)
-* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
-* **test**: Adding missing tests
-* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
-  generation
-
-### Scope
-The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example
-`Observable`, `Subject`, `switchMap`, etc.
-
-### Subject
-The subject contains succinct description of the change:
-
-* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
-* don't capitalize first letter
-* no dot (.) at the end
-
-### Body
-Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
-The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
-
-### Footer
-The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
-reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
-
-**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

-# Migrating from RxJS 4 to 5
-
-RxJS 5 is a ground-up rewrite of RxJS that actually began development when RxJS was in 2.0. This new version of RxJS had
-three basic goals:
-
-1. Better performance
-2. Better debugging
-3. Compliance with the [ES7 Observable Spec](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable)
-
-Meeting the above goals meant breaking changes to the RxJS API, and a complete rewrite means that we had opportunity
-to change/fix/correct things we've wanted to correct about RxJS in general.
-
-## Key Component Classes Are Recomposed
-
-They are similar to other language implementations of ReactiveX (e.g. RxJava).
-
-|RxJS 4|RxJS 5| remarks |
-|---|---|---|
-|`Observer`|`Subscriber` implements `Observer`| `Observer` is an interface now |
-|`IDisposable`|`Subscription`|`Subscription` is a class, not an interface.|
-
-
-## Observer Interface Changes (also Subjects)
-
-Due to wanting to comply with the ES7 Observable Spec (goal 3 above), the Observer interface (as implemented by
-Observers and Subjects alike) has changed.
-
-- `observer.onNext(value)` -> `observer.next(value)`
-- `observer.onError(err)` -> `observer.error(err)`
-- `observer.onCompleted()` -> `observer.complete()`
-
-So what was once `subject.onNext("hi")` is now `subject.next("hi")`.
-
-## Subscription `dispose` is now `unsubscribe`
-
-To meet the Observable spec (goal 3) `dispose` had to be renamed to `unsubscribe`.
-
-<!-- skip-example -->
-```js
-var subscription = myObservable.subscribe(doSomething);
-// RxJS 4: subscription.dispose();
-subscription.unsubscribe();
-```
-
-## Subscription: All Subscriptions Are "Composite"
-
-In RxJS 4, there was the idea of a `CompositeSubscription`. Now all Subscriptions are "composite".
-Subscription objects have an `add` and `remove` method on them useful for adding and removing subscriptions
-enabling "composite" subscription behavior.
-
-## Operators Renamed or Removed
-
-|RxJS 4|RxJS 5|
-|---|---|
-|`amb`|`race`|
-|`bufferWithCount`|`bufferCount`|
-|`bufferWithTime`|`bufferTime`|
-|`flatMap` or `selectMany`|`mergeMap` or `flatMap`(alias)|
-|`flatMapFirst`|`exhaustMap`|
-|`flatMapLatest`|`switchMap`|
-|`flatMapWithMaxConcurrent`|`mergeMap` or `flatMap`(alias)|
-|`fromCallback`|`bindCallback`|
-|`fromNodeCallback`|`bindNodeCallback`|
-|`publishValue`|`publishBehavior`|
-|`replay`|`publishReplay`|
-|`return` or `just`|`of`|
-|`select`|`map`|
-|`selectConcat`|`concatMap`|
-|`switchFirst`|`exhaust`|
-|`tap`|`do`|
-|`windowWithTime`|`windowTime`|

-## Operator Splits

-To reduce polymorphism and get better performance out of operators, some operators have been split into more than one operator:

-    </tr>
-  </tbody>
-</table>
-
-
-## Default Scheduling Changed
-
-RxJS v4 defaulted to a scheduler called `Rx.Scheduler.asap` which schedules on the micro task queue. RxJS v5 however defaults to having no scheduler at all; v4 called this `Rx.Scheduler.immediate`. This was done to increase performance for the most common use cases.
-
-
-## Schedulers Renamed
-
-The names of the Schedulers in RxJS 4 were based off of the Rx.NET implementation. Consequently, some of the names
-didn't make sense in a JavaScript context (for example: `currentThread` when there's only one thread anyhow).
-
-|RxJS 4|RxJS 5||
-|------|------|---|
-|`Rx.Scheduler.default`|`Rx.Scheduler.asap`|schedules on the micro task queue|
-|`Rx.Scheduler.currentThread`|`Rx.Scheduler.queue`|schedules on a queue in the current event frame (trampoline scheduler)|
-|`Rx.Scheduler.immediate`|`undefined`|by not passing a scheduler to operators that request it, it defaults to recursive execution|
-
-
-## Unimplemented Operators/Features
-
-If there is a feature that used to exist in RxJS 4, but no longer does in RxJS 5, please be sure to file an issue (and preferably a PR).
-In your issue, please describe the use case you have for the operator so we can better understand your need and prioritize it, and/or find
-and alternative way to compose the desired behavior.

-# RxJS 5 (beta)
-
-Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript. This is a rewrite of [Reactive-Extensions/RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and is intended to supersede it once this is ready. This rewrite is meant to have better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.

-## Installation and Usage
-
-### ES6 via npm
-
-```sh
-npm install rxjs-es
-```
-
-To import the entire core set of functionality:
-
-```js
-import Rx from 'rxjs/Rx';
-
-Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3)
-```
-
-To import only what you need by patching (this is useful for size-sensitive bundling):
-
-```js
-import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
-import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';
-
-Observable.of(1,2,3).map(x => x + '!!!'); // etc
-```
-
-To import what you need and use it with ES next function bind (best overall method, if possible):
-
-```js
-import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
-import { map } from 'rxjs/operator/map';
-
-Observable.of(1,2,3)::map(x => x + '!!!'); // etc
-```
-
-### CommonJS via npm
-
-```sh
-npm install rxjs
-```
-
-Import all core functionality:
-
-```js
-var Rx = require('rxjs/Rx');
-
-Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3); // etc
-```
-
-Import only what you need and patch Observable (this is useful in size-sensitive bundling scenarios):
-
-```js
-var Observable = require('rxjs/Observable').Observable;
-// patch Observable with appropriate methods
-require('rxjs/add/operator/map');
-
-Observable.of(1,2,3).map(function (x) { return x + '!!!'; }); // etc
-```
-
-Import operators and use them _manually_ you can do the following (this is also useful for bundling):
-
-```js
-var Observable = require('rxjs/Observable').Observable;
-var map = require('rxjs/operator/map').map;
-
-map.call(Observable.of(1,2,3), function (x) { return x + '!!!'; });
-```
-
-You can also use the above method to build your own Observable and export it from your own module.
-
-
-### All Module Types (CJS/ES6/AMD/TypeScript) via npm
-
-To install this library via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) **version 3**, use the following command:
-
-```sh
-npm install @reactivex/rxjs
-```
-
-If you are using npm **version 2** before this library has achieved a stable version, you need to specify the library version explicitly:
-
-```sh
-npm install @reactivex/rxjs@5.0.0-beta.1
-```
-
-### CDN
-
-For CDN, you can use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):
-
-5.0.0-beta.1 - 5.0.0-beta.11:
-
-https://unpkg.com/@reactivex/rxjs/dist/global/Rx.umd.js
-
-
-5.0.0-beta.12 or higher:
-
-https://unpkg.com/@reactivex/rxjs/dist/global/Rx.js
-
-#### Node.js Usage:
-
-```js
-var Rx = require('@reactivex/rxjs');
-
-Rx.Observable.of('hello world')
-  .subscribe(function(x) { console.log(x); });
-```
-
-## Goals
-
-- Provide better performance than preceding versions of RxJS
-- To model/follow the [Observable Spec Proposal](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable) to the observable.
-- Provide more modular file structure in a variety of formats
-- Provide more debuggable call stacks than preceding versions of RxJS
-
-## Building/Testing
-
-The build and test structure is fairly primitive at the moment. There are various npm scripts that can be run:
-
-- build_es6: Transpiles the TypeScript files from `src/` to `dist/es6`
-- build_cjs: Transpiles the ES6 files from `dist/es6` to `dist/cjs`
-- build_amd: Transpiles the ES6 files from `dist/es6` to `dist/amd`
-- build_global: Transpiles/Bundles the CommonJS files from `dist/cjs` to `dist/global/Rx.js`
-- build_all: Performs all of the above in the proper order.
-- build_test: builds ES6, then CommonJS, then runs the tests with `jasmine`
-- build_perf: builds ES6, CommonJS, then global, then runs the performance tests with `protractor`
-- build_docs: generates API documentation from `dist/es6` to `dist/docs`
-- build_cover: runs `istanbul` code coverage against test cases
-- test: runs tests with `jasmine`, must have built prior to running.
-- tests2png: generates PNG marble diagrams from test cases.
-
-`npm run info` will list available script.
-
-### Example
-
-```sh
-# build all the things!
-npm run build_all
-```
-
-## Performance Tests
-
-Run `npm run build_perf` or `npm run perf` to run the performance tests with `protractor`.
-Run `npm run perf_micro` to run micro performance test benchmarking operator.
-
-## Adding documentation
-RxNext uses [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/) to generate API documentation. Refer to ESDoc's documentation for syntax. Run `npm run build_docs` to generate.
-
-## Generating PNG marble diagrams
-
-The script `npm run tests2png` requires some native packages installed locally: `imagemagick`, `graphicsmagick`, and `ghostscript`.
-
-For Mac OS X with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
-
-- `brew install imagemagick`
-- `brew install graphicsmagick`
-- `brew install ghostscript`
-
-For Debian Linux:
-
-- `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dhor/myway`
-- `apt-get install imagemagick`
-- `apt-get install graphicsmagick`
-- `apt-get install ghostscript`
-

+### BREAKING CHANGES
+
+* Subject: Subject.create arguments have been swapped to match Rx 4 signature. `Subject.create(observable, observer)` is now `Subject.create(observer, observable)`
+* Observable patching: Patch files for static observable methods such as `of` and `from` can now be found in `rxjs/add/observable/of`, `rxjs/add/observable/from`, etc.
+* Observable modules: Observable modules for subclassed Observables like `PromiseObservable`, `ArrayObservable` are now in appropriately named files like `rxjs/observable/PromiseObservable` and `rxjs/observable/ArrayObservable`
+  as opposed to `rxjs/observable/fromPromise` and `rxjs/observable/fromArray`, since they're not patching, they simply house the Observable implementations.

+
+### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
+Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:
+
+* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/pulls) for an open or closed PR
+  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
+* Make your changes in a new git branch:
+
+     ```shell
+     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
+     ```
+
+* Create your patch, following [code style guidelines](#code), and **including appropriate test cases**.
+* Run the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.
+* Run the micro and macro performance tests against your feature branch and compare against master
+  to ensure performance wasn't changed for the worse.
+* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
+  [commit message conventions](#commit). Adherence to these conventions
+  is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
+
+     ```shell
+     git commit -a
+     ```
+  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.
+
+* Push your branch to GitHub:
+
+    ```shell
+    git push origin my-fix-branch
+    ```
+
+* In GitHub, send a pull request to `RxJS:master`.
+* If we suggest changes then:
+  * Make the required updates.
+  * Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
+  * Re-run performance tests to make sure your changes didn't hurt performance.
+  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):
+
+    ```shell
+    git rebase master -i
+    git push -f
+    ```
+
+That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
+
+
+#### After your pull request is merged
+
+After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
+from the main (upstream) repository:
+
+* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:
+
+    ```shell
+    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
+    ```
+
+* Check out the master branch:
+
+    ```shell
+    git checkout master -f
+    ```
+
+* Delete the local branch:
+
+    ```shell
+    git branch -D my-fix-branch
+    ```
+
+* Update your master with the latest upstream version:
+
+    ```shell
+    git pull --ff upstream master
+    ```
+
+### Coding Style Guidelines
+
+- Please use proper types and generics throughout your code.
+- 2 space indentation only
+- favor readability over terseness
+
+(TBD): For now try to follow the style that exists elsewhere in the source, and use your best judgment.
+
+
+### Unit Tests
+
+Unit tests are located under the [spec directory](/spec). Unit tests over synchronous operators and operations
+can be written in a standard [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) style. Unit tests written against any
+asynchronous operator should be written in [Marble Test Style outlined in detail here](doc/writing-marble-tests.md).
+
+Each operator under test must be in its own file to cover the following cases:
+
+- Never
+- Empty
+- Single/Multiple Values
+- Error in the sequence
+- Never ending sequences
+- Early disposal in sequences
+
+If the operator accepts a function as an argument from the user/developer (for example `filter(fn)` or `zip(a, fn)`),
+then it must cover the following cases:
+
+- Success with all values in the callback
+- Success with the context, if any allowed in the operator signature
+- If an error is thrown
+
+#### CI Tests
+- Using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) on your forked version of RxJS will allow running CI tests on that fork before submitting a PR to master
+ - Simply create a `Travis` account and add your fork as a new project
+- [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) setup will allow performing automated browser tests on the fork. Since `saucelabs` doesn't perform browser tests on a PR, this will help verify test results before PR's are checked into master.
+ - In your `Travis` repo configuration, set the environment variables SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY to your `saucelabs` account ([reference](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1210596/12679038/b9ba4eb6-c656-11e5-8c9b-b063c9a3f9dc.png))
+- As master runs both of these tests per each check in, it'd be welcome to setup those test before creating your PR
+
+### Performance Tests
+
+One of the primary goals of this library is (and will continue to be) great performance. As such, we've employed a variety of performance
+testing techniques.
+
+  - DON'T labor over minute variations in ops/sec or milliseconds, there will always be variance in perf test results.
+  - DON'T alter a performance test unless absolutely necessary. Performance tests may be compared to previous results from previous builds.
+  - DO run tests multiple times and make sure the margins of error are low
+  - DO run tests in your feature branches and compare them to master
+  - DO add performance tests for all new operators
+  - DO add performance tests that you feel are missing from other operators
+  - DO add additional performance tests for all worthy code paths. If you develop an operator with special handling for scalar observables,
+    please add tests for those scenarios
+
+
+#### Macro
+
+[Macro performance tests](perf/macro) are best written for scenarios where many object instance allocations (or deallocations) are occurring. Operators
+that create a lot of child subscriptions, or operators that emit new objects like Observables and Subjects are definitely worth creating
+macro performance tests for.
+
+Other scenarios for macro performance testing may include common end-to-end scenarios from real-world apps. If you have a situation in your
+app where you feel RxJS is performing poorly, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/) and include a minimal code example showing
+your performance issues. We would love to solve perf for your real-world problems and add those tests to our perf test battery.
+
+Macro performance tests can be run by hosting the root directory with any web server (we use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)),
+then running:
+
+```sh
+npm run build_all
+protractor protractor.conf.js
+```
+
+
+#### Micro
+
+[Micro performance tests](perf/micro) really only serve to test operations per second. They're quick and easy to develop, and provide a reasonable look into the
+relative performance of our operators versus prior versions. All operators should have corresponding micro performance tests.
+
+Micro performance test can be run with:
+
+```sh
+npm run build_all
+node perf/micro
+```
+
+If you wish to run a single micro performance test, you can do so by providing a single argument with the name of the perf test file(s):
+
+```sh
+node perf/micro zip
+```
+
+## Commit Message Guidelines
+
+We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
+readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
+we use the git commit messages to **generate the RxJS change log**. Helper script `npm run commit`
+provides command line based wizard to format commit message easily.
+
+### Commit Message Format
+Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
+format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:
+
+```
+<type>(<scope>): <subject>
+<BLANK LINE>
+<body>
+<BLANK LINE>
+<footer>
+```
+
+The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.
+
+Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
+to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
+
+### Revert
+If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
+
+### Type
+Must be one of the following:
+
+* **feat**: A new feature
+* **fix**: A bug fix
+* **docs**: Documentation only changes
+* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
+  semi-colons, etc)
+* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
+* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
+* **test**: Adding missing tests
+* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
+  generation
+
+### Scope
+The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example
+`Observable`, `Subject`, `switchMap`, etc.
+
+### Subject
+The subject contains succinct description of the change:
+
+* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
+* don't capitalize first letter
+* no dot (.) at the end
+
+### Body
+Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
+The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
+
+### Footer
+The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
+reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
+
+**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

+# Migrating from RxJS 4 to 5
+
+RxJS 5 is a ground-up rewrite of RxJS that actually began development when RxJS was in 2.0. This new version of RxJS had
+three basic goals:
+
+1. Better performance
+2. Better debugging
+3. Compliance with the [ES7 Observable Spec](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable)
+
+Meeting the above goals meant breaking changes to the RxJS API, and a complete rewrite means that we had opportunity
+to change/fix/correct things we've wanted to correct about RxJS in general.
+
+## Key Component Classes Are Recomposed
+
+They are similar to other language implementations of ReactiveX (e.g. RxJava).
+
+|RxJS 4|RxJS 5| remarks |
+|---|---|---|
+|`Observer`|`Subscriber` implements `Observer`| `Observer` is an interface now |
+|`IDisposable`|`Subscription`|`Subscription` is a class, not an interface.|
+
+
+## Observer Interface Changes (also Subjects)
+
+Due to wanting to comply with the ES7 Observable Spec (goal 3 above), the Observer interface (as implemented by
+Observers and Subjects alike) has changed.
+
+- `observer.onNext(value)` -> `observer.next(value)`
+- `observer.onError(err)` -> `observer.error(err)`
+- `observer.onCompleted()` -> `observer.complete()`
+
+So what was once `subject.onNext("hi")` is now `subject.next("hi")`.
+
+## Subscription `dispose` is now `unsubscribe`
+
+To meet the Observable spec (goal 3) `dispose` had to be renamed to `unsubscribe`.
+
+<!-- skip-example -->
+```js
+var subscription = myObservable.subscribe(doSomething);
+// RxJS 4: subscription.dispose();
+subscription.unsubscribe();
+```
+
+## Subscription: All Subscriptions Are "Composite"
+
+In RxJS 4, there was the idea of a `CompositeSubscription`. Now all Subscriptions are "composite".
+Subscription objects have an `add` and `remove` method on them useful for adding and removing subscriptions
+enabling "composite" subscription behavior.
+
+## Operators Renamed or Removed
+
+|RxJS 4|RxJS 5|
+|---|---|
+|`amb`|`race`|
+|`bufferWithCount`|`bufferCount`|
+|`bufferWithTime`|`bufferTime`|
+|`flatMap` or `selectMany`|`mergeMap` or `flatMap`(alias)|
+|`flatMapFirst`|`exhaustMap`|
+|`flatMapLatest`|`switchMap`|
+|`flatMapWithMaxConcurrent`|`mergeMap` or `flatMap`(alias)|
+|`fromCallback`|`bindCallback`|
+|`fromNodeCallback`|`bindNodeCallback`|
+|`publishValue`|`publishBehavior`|
+|`replay`|`publishReplay`|
+|`return` or `just`|`of`|
+|`select`|`map`|
+|`selectConcat`|`concatMap`|
+|`switchFirst`|`exhaust`|
+|`tap`|`do`|

+## Operator Splits
+
+To reduce polymorphism and get better performance out of operators, some operators have been split into more than one operator:

+
+
+## Default Scheduling Changed
+
+RxJS v4 defaulted to a scheduler called `Rx.Scheduler.asap` which schedules on the micro task queue. RxJS v5 however defaults to having no scheduler at all; v4 called this `Rx.Scheduler.immediate`. This was done to increase performance for the most common use cases.
+
+
+## Schedulers Renamed
+
+The names of the Schedulers in RxJS 4 were based off of the Rx.NET implementation. Consequently, some of the names
+didn't make sense in a JavaScript context (for example: `currentThread` when there's only one thread anyhow).
+
+|RxJS 4|RxJS 5||
+|------|------|---|
+|`Rx.Scheduler.default`|`Rx.Scheduler.asap`|schedules on the micro task queue|
+|`Rx.Scheduler.currentThread`|`Rx.Scheduler.queue`|schedules on a queue in the current event frame (trampoline scheduler)|
+|`Rx.Scheduler.immediate`|`undefined`|by not passing a scheduler to operators that request it, it defaults to recursive execution|
+
+
+## Unimplemented Operators/Features
+
+If there is a feature that used to exist in RxJS 4, but no longer does in RxJS 5, please be sure to file an issue (and preferably a PR).
+In your issue, please describe the use case you have for the operator so we can better understand your need and prioritize it, and/or find
+and alternative way to compose the desired behavior.

+# RxJS 5 (beta)
+
+Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript. This is a rewrite of [Reactive-Extensions/RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and is intended to supersede it once this is ready. This rewrite is meant to have better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.

+
+## Installation and Usage
+
+### ES6 via npm
+
+```sh
+npm install rxjs-es
+```
+
+To import the entire core set of functionality:
+
+```js
+import Rx from 'rxjs/Rx';
+
+Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3)
+```
+
+To import only what you need by patching (this is useful for size-sensitive bundling):
+
+```js
+import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
+import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';
+
+Observable.of(1,2,3).map(x => x + '!!!'); // etc
+```
+
+To import what you need and use it with ES next function bind (best overall method, if possible):
+
+```js
+import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
+import { map } from 'rxjs/operator/map';
+
+Observable.of(1,2,3)::map(x => x + '!!!'); // etc
+```
+
+### CommonJS via npm
+
+```sh
+npm install rxjs
+```
+
+Import all core functionality:
+
+```js
+var Rx = require('rxjs/Rx');
+
+Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3); // etc
+```
+
+Import only what you need and patch Observable (this is useful in size-sensitive bundling scenarios):
+
+```js
+var Observable = require('rxjs/Observable').Observable;
+// patch Observable with appropriate methods
+require('rxjs/add/operator/map');
+
+Observable.of(1,2,3).map(function (x) { return x + '!!!'; }); // etc
+```
+
+Import operators and use them _manually_ you can do the following (this is also useful for bundling):
+
+```js
+var Observable = require('rxjs/Observable').Observable;
+var map = require('rxjs/operator/map').map;
+
+map.call(Observable.of(1,2,3), function (x) { return x + '!!!'; });
+```
+
+You can also use the above method to build your own Observable and export it from your own module.
+
+
+### All Module Types (CJS/ES6/AMD/TypeScript) via npm
+
+To install this library via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) **version 3**, use the following command:
+
+```sh
+npm install @reactivex/rxjs
+```
+
+If you are using npm **version 2** before this library has achieved a stable version, you need to specify the library version explicitly:
+
+```sh
+npm install @reactivex/rxjs@5.0.0-beta.1
+```
+
+### CDN
+
+For CDN, you can use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):
+
+5.0.0-beta.1 - 5.0.0-beta.11:
+
+https://unpkg.com/@reactivex/rxjs/dist/global/Rx.umd.js
+
+
+5.0.0-beta.12 or higher:
+
+https://unpkg.com/@reactivex/rxjs/dist/global/Rx.js
+
+#### Node.js Usage:
+
+```js
+var Rx = require('@reactivex/rxjs');
+
+Rx.Observable.of('hello world')
+  .subscribe(function(x) { console.log(x); });
+```
+
+## Goals
+
+- Provide better performance than preceding versions of RxJS
+- To model/follow the [Observable Spec Proposal](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable) to the observable.
+- Provide more modular file structure in a variety of formats
+- Provide more debuggable call stacks than preceding versions of RxJS
+
+## Building/Testing
+
+The build and test structure is fairly primitive at the moment. There are various npm scripts that can be run:
+
+- build_es6: Transpiles the TypeScript files from `src/` to `dist/es6`
+- build_cjs: Transpiles the ES6 files from `dist/es6` to `dist/cjs`
+- build_amd: Transpiles the ES6 files from `dist/es6` to `dist/amd`
+- build_global: Transpiles/Bundles the CommonJS files from `dist/cjs` to `dist/global/Rx.js`
+- build_all: Performs all of the above in the proper order.
+- build_test: builds ES6, then CommonJS, then runs the tests with `jasmine`
+- build_perf: builds ES6, CommonJS, then global, then runs the performance tests with `protractor`
+- build_docs: generates API documentation from `dist/es6` to `dist/docs`
+- build_cover: runs `istanbul` code coverage against test cases
+- test: runs tests with `jasmine`, must have built prior to running.
+- tests2png: generates PNG marble diagrams from test cases.
+
+`npm run info` will list available script.
+
+### Example
+
+```sh
+# build all the things!
+npm run build_all
+```
+
+## Performance Tests
+
+Run `npm run build_perf` or `npm run perf` to run the performance tests with `protractor`.
+Run `npm run perf_micro` to run micro performance test benchmarking operator.
+
+## Adding documentation
+RxNext uses [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/) to generate API documentation. Refer to ESDoc's documentation for syntax. Run `npm run build_docs` to generate.
+
+## Generating PNG marble diagrams
+
+The script `npm run tests2png` requires some native packages installed locally: `imagemagick`, `graphicsmagick`, and `ghostscript`.
+
+For Mac OS X with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
+
+- `brew install imagemagick`
+- `brew install graphicsmagick`
+- `brew install ghostscript`
+
+For Debian Linux:
+
+- `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dhor/myway`
+- `apt-get install imagemagick`
+- `apt-get install graphicsmagick`
+- `apt-get install ghostscript`
+
+For Windows and other Operating Systems, check the download instructions here:
+
+- http://imagemagick.org
+- http://www.graphicsmagick.org
+- http://www.ghostscript.com/
